What a journalling system ought to do:

single-key journal entry:

<timestamp> <text line>
            <text line> (auto-indented)

start/stop phase/interrupt/defect (PSP)

"start interrupt" should be easy (one keystroke?).  "end interrupt"
should be where interrupt details are provided.

"start <well-known task>" should be easy:  single keystroke, followed
by easy well-known task pick.  Auto-complete.

File syntax should obey UniKarlsRuhe's PSP log syntax (.pplog).
