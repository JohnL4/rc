;; Tree are assumed to have the following structure:

'(root (child-1 subchild-1a subchild-1b)
       child-2				;Leaf nodes do NOT appear in singleton
					;  lists. 
       (child-3 (subchild-3a subsubchild-3a1 subsubchild-3a2)

;; So, for any given node `n', (car n) is the value of the node, and (cdr n)
;; is the list of children of n.
;;
;; Node comparison is done with `eq', so node values cannot be complex.  They
;; are assumed to be symbols.
