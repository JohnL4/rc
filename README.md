# rc
My various .rc files, including .emacs, ~/Lisp/*.el in all their glory, and main PowerShell profiles.  Note that PowerShell SCRIPTS will be in a different repo, since two repos can't share a working directory (right? right?).

Note that the `windows-10` branch was created from my Windows 10 `c:\Users\<myUserName>\AppData\Roaming`, so it probably doesn't include whatever changes are associated with Cygwin, which stores its rc files in a different directory.
