# Below are the color init strings for the basic file types. A color init
# string consists of one or more of the following numeric codes:
# Attribute codes (blink makes background bright for Cygwin):
# 00=none 01=bold 04=underscore 05=blink 07=reverse 08=concealed
# Text color codes:
# 30=black 31=red 32=green 33=yellow 34=blue 35=magenta 36=cyan 37=white
# Background color codes:
# 40=black 41=red 42=green 43=yellow 44=blue 45=magenta 46=cyan 47=white
NORMAL 00	# global default, although everything should be something.
FILE 00 	# normal file
DIR 34 	# directory
LINK 36 	# symbolic link.  (If you set this to 'target' instead of a
           	# numerical value, the color is as for the file pointed to.)
FIFO 40;33	# pipe
SOCK 35	# socket
DOOR 35	# door
BLK 40;33	# block device driver
CHR 40;33 	# character device driver
ORPHAN 1;40;31  # symlink to nonexistent file
STICKY_OTHER_WRITABLE 01;05;30;42 # dir that is sticky and other-writable (+t,o+w)
OTHER_WRITABLE 01;05;34;42 # dir that is other-writable (o+w) and not sticky
# This is for files with execute permission:
EXEC 32

# List any file extensions like '.gz' or '.tar' that you would like ls
# to colorize below. Put the extension, a space, and the color init string.
# (and any comments you want to add after a '#')
